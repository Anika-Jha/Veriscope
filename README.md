##  Why Veriscope? 
We live in an era where information flows faster than everâ€”yet trust and truth are under constant threat.  
**Media and Information Literacy (MIL)**, as promoted by UNESCO, is a vital skillset for learners and citizens worldwide.  

Veriscope turns MIL concepts into **engaging, hands-on games**. Instead of just *reading about misinformation*, players **experience it**, reflect on their decisions, and build lasting skills.  

### By playing Veriscope, learners:
- Train themselves to **spot unreliable sources**  
- Recognize **echo chamber effects** and cognitive bias  
- Practice **fact verification techniques** with real-world inspired cases  
- Reflect on **takeaways and strategies** to use outside the game
