## Veriscope –  Web App 
## Core Idea

A 2D browser-based web app with four mini-games that teach Media & Information Literacy (MIL) in fun, story-driven ways.
Each game presents interactive scenarios, judges the player’s choice in real time (via rules/heuristics, not expensive AI), and delivers personalized insights about how that choice affects society, democracy, and human rights.
Fallback hardcoded storylines are included so it works even offline.
