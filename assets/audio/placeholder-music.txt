## Usage Notes:
- All music should be royalty-free with appropriate licenses
- Audio files should be optimized for web (128kbps MP3 or OGG)
- Tracks should loop seamlessly without noticeable breaks
- Volume levels should be consistent across all tracks
- Consider providing both MP3 and OGG formats for browser compatibility

## Current Implementation:
The AudioManager class generates synthetic background music using Web Audio API as a fallback when audio files are not available. This ensures the application functions properly even without external audio assets.

## Legal Requirements:
- Ensure all audio has proper licensing for commercial use
- Maintain attribution files for Creative Commons licensed content
- Keep documentation of license terms for each audio file
