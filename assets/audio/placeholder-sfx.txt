- Test effects with screen readers for accessibility compliance

## Current Fallback:
The AudioManager class uses Web Audio API to generate synthetic sound effects when audio files are unavailable. This includes:
- Oscillator-based tones for different effect types
- Programmatically generated chords and melodies
- Frequency modulation for various sound characteristics

## Accessibility Considerations:
