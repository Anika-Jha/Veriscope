You are an expert full-stack game developer. Build me a complete interactive **web app called "Veriscope"** with **4 mini-games** inside one app. Each mini-game has its own unique vibe, UI, background music, sound effects, and learning goal. The game must be fully functional — do not use placeholders or TODOs. All fallback stories, dialogues, music, and sound effects must be included directly in the code and assets. The final project should run in the browser, be responsive on desktop and mobile, and portable for deployment on Render.

📌 Core Features:
- Landing page → "Start Veriscope" button → leads to game hub.
- Game hub with 4 clickable mini-games.
- Each mini-game uses AI-based judgment of user choices:
   - Use Hugging Face free models (sentiment, credibility, fake news detection).
   - Or ml5.js / TensorFlow.js for local AI.
   - If AI fails → use **pre-written fallback stories** (10+ per mini-game).
   - All fallback stories must be coded into the project now, no placeholders.
- Each mini-game ends with a "Flashcard of Learnings".
- Track progress across all 4 games → show final celebratory summary when complete.
- Background music & SFX per mini-game, toggleable in corner.
- Store all audio locally from royalty-free sources (e.g., FreeSound, Pixabay Music).
